This word guessing game has everyone posting their results
on social media. We probably become obsessed because we are rationed to one game a
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you also obsessed with football? A football-phile, a nerd, or a fan-atic whose player
knowledge is legendary. We soon become addicted to our PC console football games; Football Manager,
FIFA or PES. We can’t get enough of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens though, when the worlds of Wordle and Football collide?
Simples… it’s Football Wordle, the new and challenging phenomena for people of all ages. Games including &lt;a href=&quot;https://footbl5.com/&quot;&gt;Footbl 5&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://footbl6.com/&quot;&gt;Footbl 6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://missing11.com/&quot;&gt;Missing 11&lt;/a&gt; are each as challenging as one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Footbl connoisseur will enjoy constructing the surnames of professional footballers in
both 5 and 6 word formats. The progression then is to challenge yourself further with the 11
missing players iconic game format, inspired by Sky Sports’ &lt;em&gt;Missing Men&lt;/em&gt;. Can you name the Liverpool team who won the
European Cup against AC Milan in 2005? Beat your mates, in this ultimate test of football
knowledge. Then share on social media - if you’re good enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget the Rest, Play the Best.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
